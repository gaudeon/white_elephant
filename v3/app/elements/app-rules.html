    <h2>Rules</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>All gifts should be assigned identifiers, (e.g. number on a sticky note)</li>
        <li>Enter in all players and the gifts they brought by id.</li>
        <li>When play is chosen, gifts are randomly assigned to the players.</li>
        <li>After assignment is completed, choose the continue option to determine the order of play.</li>
        <li>A players turn consists of either opening the gift they have OR swapping with a gift someone else has (wrapped or unwrapped). Players only get one chance to swap.</li>
        <li>When all players have completed their turn the exchange is complete. Of course trading after the exchange could happen :)</li>
        <li>Merry/Happy/etc. &lt;Insert Holiday Here&gt;</li>
